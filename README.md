# ABOUT

I'm making a version of 20 questions where it's only about locations. A user will be able to start a game and invite someone by sending them a link. Once in the game the invited person will have a set number of questions to ask to in order to find the location. 

**I'm making this project to work on my skill specifically with Mapbox GL, Websockets, TDD, Frontend Interactivity, React, Redux, Node, & MongoDB.**
