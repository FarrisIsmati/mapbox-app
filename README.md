** ABOUT
I'm trying to make a version of 20 questions where it's only about locations. A user will be able to start a game and invite someone by sending them a link. Once in the game the invited person will have a set number of questions to ask to in order to find the location. 
This is a project to work on my frontend interactivity skills and utilizie Websockets.
